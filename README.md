# Hockey_Unicorn
Analyzing and experimenting with NHL data from public sources. The idea is that everyone in the NHL or who is qualified to play in the NHL is a unicorn: they are special. While it won't paint the full picture, I want to solve what makes them special through data analysis. At the end of the day, Hockey is a game of people. The people work together like a complex puzzle. We should think outside of the box when analysing data; context matters. I want to find what roles enables players to play to their potential and determine what is holding them back. Rating players based on their WAR is too subjective. We need to rate players based on how they FIT with systems, role players, and hard data like age, size, jersey number.

This project should provide context to those interested in the people that play in the NHL and not just the name on the back of their sweater.
